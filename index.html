I started programming in May of 2021 and started working professionally in July 2022. The first language that I learnt and the one that I work in primarily is Python, though I spent several months just nerding over Rust sometime back, proof of which can found in my blogs and projects. I am also exploring and practicing frontend technologies.<p>I am currently primarily hacking on <a href=https://github.com/dhruv-ahuja/backend_burger>backend_burger</a> and learning about scalable backend concepts plus some computer science concepts as well.<h2 id=interests>Interests</h2><p>I was learning Spanish and French before pivoting to tech, it has been two plus years now but I still listen to Spanish songs on a regular basis. Reading is a big passion of mine and I delve into long reading sessions frequently. I have sometime back finished the Witcher and Mistborn (1st generation) series.<p>I’m also into audio-gear – <a href=https://en.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble-v3>Creative Pebble V3</a> for the desk and the <a href=https://shenzhenaudio.com/products/truthear-zero-earphone-dual-dynamic-drivers-pu-lcp-composite-diaphragm-in-ear-headphone>Truthear X Crinacle Zero</a>, EQd to Project Red V3, for mostly all other occasions. Both of these options are great value products and I’m super happy with them, for the time being :P I have also recently upgraded to the RK84 V2 keyboard with Gateron brown switches, a bliss to type on and has helluva battery life.<h2 id=contact>Contact</h2><p>You can write to me at <a href=mailto:dhruvahuja2k@gmail.com>my email</a>, connect with me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvahuja2k/>LinkedIn</a> and find my side-activity and projects on <a href=https://github.com/dhruv-ahuja/>Github</a>.</section></article></main></div></body><footer><p>Made with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a>, using a <a href=https://github.com/dhruv-ahuja/apollo-custom target=_blank>custom variant</a> of the <a href=https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo target=_blank>Apollo</a> theme.</footer>
